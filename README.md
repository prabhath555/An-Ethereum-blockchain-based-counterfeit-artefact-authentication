# An-Ethereum-blockchain-based-counterfeit-artefact-authentication
# ABSTRACT
Counterfeit goods present a significant global challenge, causing consumers to unknowingly purchase inauthentic products without a reliable means of verification.In response to this issue, blockchain technology has gained prominence as a tool for establishing trust among distrustful participants. The  proposes is a novel approach that utilizes blockchain to address the sale of counterfeit products.The core concept involves manufacturers adding authentic product serial numbers to a decentralized ledger, enabling consumers to verify the legitimacy of a product before making a purchase. Blockchain technology plays a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity of the data, safeguarding against tampering and creating a secure and trusted environment.  This innovative application of blockchain not only provides a solution to the pervasive issue of counterfeit goods but also exemplifies the potential of blockchain in fostering transparency and trust in commercial transactions.

# INTRODUCTION
In today’s rapidly advancing technological landscape, The creation and delivery of products carry a number of hazards in the ever evolving world of technology, including the possibility of counterfeiting and duplication. These hazards may have a negative impact on a business's earnings, standing, and client safety. Blockchain technology adoption presents a viable way to address these issues as it provides a more transparent and safe substitute for conventional supply networks. Conventional supply chains are usually centralized, which means that the business offering the good or service controls the data. Although this could appear effective, it also opens the door for data manipulation by people in authority, which could result in security flaws. Because of this centralized strategy, take advantage of the reputation and value of authentic goods, which is detrimental to businesses as well as customers.

# What is a blockchain?
Blockchain is a digital ledger technology that records information in a way that is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Imagine it as a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions or data. Once information is added to a block and linked to the chain, it cannot be changed or deleted, making the entire system highly secure.
There are 3 types of blockchain:
# 1.Public Blockchains: 
    These blockchains are open to everyone. Anyone can participate as a node, validate transactions, or simply view the blockchain data. They are fully decentralized and secure but can be slower due to their size and openness.
    # Types:
      # • Bitcoin: The first and most well-known blockchain, mainly used for peer-to-peer transactions with its native cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC).
      # • Ethereum: A popular blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) using its currency, Ether (ETH).
      # • Solana: A fast, high-performance blockchain for decentralized apps and cryptocurrencies.
# 2. Private Blockchains:
    These blockchains are restricted and only accessible to specific participants. They are centralized to some extent, as a single entity or organization controls the network, making them faster and more private.
    # Types:
      # • Hyperledger Fabric: Used by enterprises for building private blockchain networks tailored for specific business needs like supply chain tracking.
      # • Corda: Designed specifically for financial institutions, it allows for secure and private transactions among parties.
      # • Quorum: A permissioned blockchain based on Ethereum, developed by J.P. Morgan for financial services.
# 3. Consortium (Federated) Blockchains:
    Managed by a group of organizations rather than a single entity, providing a semi-decentralized network. They offer more security than private blockchains and are more efficient than public ones.
    # Types:
      # • R3 Corda: Used by a consortium of banks for secure, transparent, and efficient financial transactions.
      # • Energy Web Chain: Developed for the energy sector to support and track renewable energy transactions between different companies.
      # • IBM Food Trust: A blockchain consortium aimed at improving transparency and traceability in the food supply chain.
In the current proposed system we have used :
# ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN:
Ethereum is a type of blockchain, which is like a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions in a secure and transparent way . Ethereum is decentralized, meaning it isn’t controlled by a single person or company. Instead, it runs on a network of computers all over the world, making it secure and resistant to censorship or fraud.
# METAMASK :
MetaMask is a digital wallet that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency, specifically Ether (the currency of Ethereum) and other tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain. Think of it like an online wallet for your digital money, but it also serves as a bridge to access decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. MetaMask is also one of the chrome extension used in this proposed system
# GANACHE:
Ganache is a tool used in blockchain development, specifically for Ethereum. It acts like a personal blockchain that developers can use to test their smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) locally on their computer without using the main Ethereum network.

# CONCLUSION
• The proposed system harnesses blockchain to empower consumers in distinguishing genuine items from counterfeits, bolstering trust in their purchases and product usage. 
• Blockchain integration within supply chains effectively combats counterfeit products, elevating transparency, efficiency, and trust throughout the product journey, consequently enhancing overall supply chain reliability. 
• Collaborative efforts with manufacturers, sellers, and consumers foster standardized blockchain integration protocols. This unity fights counterfeit products and encourages consistent adoption across diverse industries.
• The project delivers a user-friendly interface for consumers, simplifying the process of verifying product authenticity. This user-friendliness instills confidence in the genuineness of everyday purchases. 
• By diminishing counterfeit products and associated risks, the project acts as a pivotal guardian for consumers and markets. Additionally, it underscores the sustainability merits of supporting authentic products
